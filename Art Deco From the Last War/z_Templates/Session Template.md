## Characters  

List your Charactes here.  

## Strong Start  
  
<% await tp.system.prompt("The strong start draws players out of the real world and into the game. The key driver for the strong start is 'something happens.' Maybe the characters get attacked (a typical but potentially overused favorite). Maybe they meet a long-lost NPC. Maybe there's a festival in town. Maybe a sinkhole opens up in the road leading to the depths below. Something happens, and it draws players into the world. The strong start often leads to the hook to draw the characters into the adventure if there isn't one already.", null, false, true)%>
  
## Scenes  
  
<% await tp.system.prompt("This step is entirely designed to help GMs feel good about their prep. It sets the potential boundaries for the session. The key question is 'what scenes might occur in this session?' These scenes might be in a linear sequence or potential branches based on the choices or actions of the characters. They might be small and focused scenes or big plans like 'explore level 3 of the Scarlet Citadel.' Your outline of scenes should be **small and brief** – just a few short sentences in a list. Don't overdo it. Keep it brief and flexible and be ready to throw these scenes away if they don't actually come up in the game.", null, false, true)%>

>#### Secrets and Clues  
  >
><% await tp.system.prompt("This is the heart of the eight steps from _Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master_. Whatever steps you decide on for your prep, 'secrets and clues' may be the main one you want to include.\nThese secrets and clues have a few criteria that make them powerful:\n\n- **They're short.** Usually just a sentence or two.\n- **They're relevant.** They focus on things the characters may want to know like the history of the location or the plans of a villain.\n- **They're abstracted from the location of their discovery.** We don't determine _how_ the characters find a secret. We focus only on the secret itself and then improvise how characters find them as we run the game.\n\nThis last point is tricky to understand and critical to their value in our prep. You decide which secrets the characters uncover **during the game itself**. Maybe they learn it from an NPC. Maybe they learn it by examining a fresco on the wall. Maybe a secret comes to them in a divine vision. The [Lazy GM's Resource Document](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_gm_resource_document.html) includes ten different ways secrets might be discovered in four different categories.\n\nOriginally I recommended starting with a fresh slate of ten secrets every time you prep. Recently, many GMs, including myself, find it easier to review your last session's secrets and bring forward any secrets that have yet to be uncovered and are still relevant to the game.", null, false, true) %>
  
## Fantastic Locations  
  
<% await tp.system.prompt("Fantastic locations serve as the backdrop to the scenes we run. What locations might come up during the game? Locations might be small, like the master bedroom in a manor or a prison cell in a dungeon. They might be large backdrops for a scene like the dank alleyways of a city or an ancient fountain in the plaza at midnight. We decide how much detail we need for a location based on how important it might be in the game. For some locations, all we need is a name like 'bloody torture chamber' or 'master bedroom of shattered mirrors.'\n\nWe usually want enough of a description to help us improvise locations during the game but we often don't need more than a sentence. If we think a location is going to be the backdrop to a big set-piece battle, we might add one to three fantastic features to a location so it looks like this:\n\n- **Hall of storms**. Large pit dropping into the sky below, huge crumbling pillars, lightning-charged throne.\n\nThose 'aspects' of a location gives the characters something to mess with during a scene.\n\nIf you're running a large dungeon, you might not need anything more than the titles of the rooms in a list. If you're running a published adventure, you might not need anything at all.", null, false, true)%>
  
## Important NPCs  
  
<% await tp.system.prompt("In this step, we write down the names and any important notes for NPCs that might come up in our next session. These NPCs could be people the characters might meet, villains they might face, or even intelligent magic items the characters carry.\n\nOften the hardest part of preparing NPCs is remembering their names. Writing down their names might be all we need. We might want to build NPCs from characters in popular fiction so we have an instant set of mannerisms, dialects, and appearances. More detailed NPCs might have goals and quests they follow to accomplish those goals. To keep your NPCs fresh, switch their genders and appearances. If you can, grab artwork to show your players what the NPCs look like.", null, false, true) %>
